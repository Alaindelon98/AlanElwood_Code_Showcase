# Oniros_TFG

You can find the game here: http://www.mediafire.com/file/a46ay46ns48636j/Demo_Kale.rar/file

This is a scene fully coded and built by me as asistance for a "TFG" thesis from students at UB's Audiovisual Communication Degree.

I was given a specific set of mechanics to code and art to implement. But I also added several aspects of the game to improve it:
Like all sound, the ground, mountains and other visual assets and postprocessign as well as 3D sound so the player can find the goats easier.

I cannot speak for the core design or art in the game but I'm proud of how the scene and code worked out.

In this repository I've also added the scripts I made and some progress screenshots. Sadly the project itself is in an older Unity version and doesn't work properly anymore.
